## Quick Start

### Option 1: Claude Desktop Integration (Recommended MCP Setup)

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "canvas-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "CANVAS_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here",
        "CANVAS_DOMAIN": "your_school.instructure.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: NPM Package

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g canvas-mcp-server

# Configure
export CANVAS_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export CANVAS_DOMAIN="your_school.instructure.com"

# Run
canvas-mcp-server
```

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name canvas-mcp \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CANVAS_API_TOKEN="your_token" \
  -e CANVAS_DOMAIN="school.instructure.com" \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT="streamable-http" \
  -e MCP_HTTP_HOST="0.0.0.0" \
  -e MCP_HTTP_PORT="3000" \
  -e MCP_HTTP_PATH="/mcp" \
  ghcr.io/dmontgomery40/mcp-canvas-lms:latest
```

## Transport Modes

The server supports two explicit transport modes:

- `stdio` (default): best for Claude Desktop/Codex/Cursor local MCP wiring.
- `streamable-http`: best for local HTTP integrations and containerized workflows.

### Transport environment variables

```bash
# Required Canvas auth
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your_token
CANVAS_DOMAIN=your_school.instructure.com

# Transport selection
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio # or streamable-http

# Streamable HTTP settings
MCP_HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000
MCP_HTTP_PATH=/mcp
MCP_HTTP_STATEFUL=true
MCP_HTTP_JSON_RESPONSE=true
MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=
```

## 💼 Account Admin Workflow Examples

### Create a New Course (FIXED!)
```
"Create a new course called 'Advanced Biology' in account 123"
```
**Now properly creates courses with required account_id parameter**

### Manage Users
```
"Create a new student user John Doe with email john.doe@school.edu in our main account"
```
**Creates user accounts with proper pseudonym and enrollment setup**

### Generate Reports
```
"Generate an enrollment report for account 456 for the current term"
```
**Initiates Canvas reporting system for institutional analytics**

### List Account Courses
```
"Show me all published Computer Science courses in our Engineering account"
```
**Advanced filtering and searching across account course catalogs**

## 🎓 Student Workflow Examples

```
**Lists upcoming assignments with due dates, points, and submission status**

### Submit an Assignment
```
"Help me submit my essay for English 101 Assignment 3"
```
**Guides through text submission with formatting options**

### Check Grades
```
"What's my current grade in Biology?"
```
**Shows current scores, grades, and assignment feedback**

### Participate in Discussions
```
"Show me the latest discussion posts in my Philosophy class"
```

## 🔧 Breaking Changes in v2.2.0

### Course Creation Fix
**BEFORE (Broken):**
```javascript
{
  "tool": "canvas_create_course",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "My Course"  // ❌ Missing account_id - caused "page not found"
  }
}
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```javascript
{
  "tool": "canvas_create_course", 
  "arguments": {
    "account_id": 123,              // ✅ Required account_id
    "name": "My Course",
    "course_code": "CS-101"
  }
}
```

## 🌟 Example Claude Conversations

**Student**: *"I need to check my upcoming assignments and submit my English essay"*

**Claude**: *I'll help you check your upcoming assignments and then assist with submitting your English essay. Let me start by getting your upcoming assignments...*

[Claude uses `canvas_get_upcoming_assignments` then helps with `canvas_submit_assignment`]

---

**Instructor**: *"Create a new Advanced Physics course in the Science department and enroll my teaching assistant"*

**Claude**: *I'll help you create the Advanced Physics course in your Science department account and then enroll your TA...*

[Claude uses `canvas_create_course` with proper account_id, then `canvas_enroll_user`]

---

**Administrator**: *"Generate an enrollment report for all Computer Science courses this semester"*

**Claude**: *I'll generate a comprehensive enrollment report for your CS courses...*

[Claude uses `canvas_list_account_courses` with filters, then `canvas_create_account_report`]

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ **401 Unauthorized**: Check your API token and permissions
- ❌ **404 Not Found**: Verify course/assignment IDs and access rights  
- ❌ **"Page not found" on course creation**: Update to v2.2.0 for account_id fix
- ❌ **Timeout**: Increase `CANVAS_TIMEOUT` or check network connectivity

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
npm start
```

**Health Check:**
```bash
npm run health-check
```

## Appendix: MCP in Practice (Code Execution, Tool Scale, and Safety)

Last updated: 2026-03-23

### Why This Appendix Exists
MCP is still one of the most useful interoperability layers for agentic tooling. The tradeoff is that large MCP servers can expose dozens of tools, and naive tool-calling can flood context windows with tool schemas, call traces, and low-signal chatter.

In practice, larger tool surfaces only help when orchestration stays token-efficient and execution behavior is constrained.

### The Shift to Code Execution / Code Mode
Recent production workflows move orchestration out of conversational turns and into executable loops. This keeps context overhead lower, improves determinism, and makes runs auditable.

Core reading:
- [Cloudflare: Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/)
- [Cloudflare: Code Execution with MCP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-execution-with-mcp/)
- [Anthropic: Code Execution with MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp)

### Recommended Setup for Power Users
For lower-noise, repeatable MCP usage, start with codemode-oriented routing:
- [codemode-mcp (jx-codes)](https://github.com/jx-codes/codemode-mcp)
- [UTCP](https://www.utcp.io)

Even with strong setup, model behavior can be hit-or-miss across providers and versions. Keep retries and deterministic fallbacks.

### Peter Steinberger Workflow Pattern
A high-leverage pattern is turning broad MCP tool surfaces into narrower CLI/task interfaces:
- [MCPorter](https://github.com/steipete/mcporter)
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/steipete/openclaw)

### What Works Best With Which MCP Clients
- Claude Code / Codex / Cursor agent workflows: usually strong for direct MCP + code-execution loops.
- Thin hosted chat clients: often safer with wrapped CLIs/gateways instead of full raw tool exposure.
- High-tool-count servers: usually better when split into narrow task gateways.

This ecosystem changes quickly. If you are reading this now, parts of this section may already be out of date.

### Prompt Injection: Risks, Consequences, and Mitigations
Prompt injection remains an open problem for tool-using agents. It is manageable, but not solved.

Primary risks:
- Hidden instructions in retrieved content or tool output.
- Secret/token exfiltration through unintended calls.
- Unauthorized state changes in systems or data.

Mitigation baseline:
- Least-privilege credentials and scoped tokens.
- Destination/action allowlists and strict schema validation.
- Human confirmation for destructive operations.
- Sandboxed execution and resource limits.
- Structured logging and replayable execution traces.

Treat every tool output as untrusted input unless explicitly verified.
